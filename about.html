        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="about-content">
        <p>Hello! I'm Aadarsh Chaudhary, a dedicated Python Developer with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My expertise lies in web development, data analysis, and automation, where I utilize Python libraries such as Django, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PostgreSQL to create efficient and impactful solutions.</p>

        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <div class="education-section">
            <h3>Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering</h3>
            <p>I pursued my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Bharati Vidyapeethâ€™s College of Engineering in New Delhi. This program provided me with a solid foundation in both hardware and software engineering, allowing me to bridge the gap between engineering principles and programming applications. During my time at college, I actively engaged in leadership roles, serving as the Design Head for AthenaBVP and the Video Editing Head at BVPCSI. These positions enabled me to develop my technical skills while fostering creativity and teamwork.</p>
            
            <h3>Higher Secondary Education</h3>
            <p>Before college, I completed my higher secondary education at G.L.T Saraswati Bal Mandir in New Delhi, where I focused on the science stream with an emphasis on computer science. Achieving an 84% score, I developed a strong interest in computational thinking and the transformative power of technology, which set the stage for my future endeavors in engineering and development.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>My Journey in Technology</h2>
        <p>From an early age, I was fascinated by how technology can be harnessed to solve complex problems and improve lives. This curiosity led me to explore various facets of programming and data science. Python quickly became my language of choice due to its versatility and the robust ecosystem of libraries it offers. Whether it's building dynamic web applications with Django and Flask or analyzing large datasets with Pandas and NumPy, Python provides the tools I need to turn ideas into reality.</p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>My professional journey includes an enriching internship as an AI Engineer Intern at SKXYWTF, a financial services company specializing in artificial intelligence and data-driven solutions. During this internship, I was responsible for designing and implementing machine learning algorithms and neural networks, optimizing their performance across various platforms. I also conducted performance testing and benchmarking of web applications and machine learning models, ensuring their reliability and efficiency. This role not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me valuable insights into the application of AI in the financial sector.</p>

        <h2>Projects That Define Me</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic and professional career, I've worked on several projects that highlight my ability to apply Python in diverse domains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stock Prediction with Trading:</strong> Utilizing Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, VectorBT, and Alpaca, I developed a stock prediction model integrated with trading capabilities. This project involved backtesting strategies to evaluate performance and refine prediction accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Card Fraud Detection:</strong> Leveraging machine learning techniques, I created a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using Pandas and Scikit-learn, I processed and analyzed transaction data to identify patterns indicative of fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>Super Market Sales Prediction:</strong> This project focused on predicting sales trends in a supermarket setting. I employed libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and Scikit-learn to visualize data and build predictive models that provide actionable insights into consumer behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>As I continue to grow in my career, I am eager to delve deeper into advanced areas of data science and artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning and cloud-based AI solutions. I am committed to continuous learning and am always seeking opportunities to tackle new challenges that allow me to apply my skills in innovative ways.</p>
